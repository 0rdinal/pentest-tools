# HackTheBox PwnBox Configuration

This file contains a `user_init` file I use to customise my Pwnbox instance. 
You will need to change line 4 and 5 to replace my username with your own.

With this setup, everything within `~/htb/` will be saved between instances.
Keep in mind that the Pwnbox does not allocate much space for you instance so this can quickly be filled.  I noticed this issue when I tried to use Hydra and its restore file used the entire capacity of the instance.
